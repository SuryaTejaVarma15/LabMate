# LabMate
LabMate is a smart assistant that helps students interact with their lab manuals in a simple, conversational way. Instead of flipping through pages to find formulas, diagrams, or experiment steps, students can upload a lab manual PDF and ask questions â€” just like chatting with a knowledgeable assistant.
